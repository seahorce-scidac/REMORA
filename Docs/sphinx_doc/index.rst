ROMSX
-----

ROMSX is currently under development as a next-generation version of the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS).

ROMSX is built on `AMReX <https://github.com/AMReX-Codes/amrex>`_,
an adaptive mesh refinement software framework, which provides the underlying software infrastructure for
block structured AMR operations.
The full AMReX documentation can be found `here <https://amrex-codes.github.io/amrex/docs_html/>`_ and the tutorials can be found `here <https://amrex-codes.github.io/amrex/tutorials_html/>`_.

ROMSX is designed to run on machines from laptops to multicore CPU and hybrid CPU/GPU systems.

This documentation is currently under development, there are detailed resources available on `the ROMS Documentation Portal <https://www.myroms.org/wiki/Documentation_Portal>`_ for the Regional Ocean Modeling System.

In addition to this documentation, there is API documentation for ERF generated by `Doxygen <https://seahorce-scidac.github.io/docs/index.html>`_.
