REMORA
------

REMORA is a new GPU-enabled code designed to replicate the functionality of the ROMS code but with the ability to exploit GPU architectures.

`REMORA` is built upon the `AMReX <https://amrex-codes.github.io/amrex/>`_ software framework
for massively parallel block-structured applications. The AMReX software framework provides performance portability across multiple architectures.

Getting Started
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

See `Getting Started <https://remora-ocean.readthedocs.io/en/latest/GettingStarted.html>`_ for instructions as to how to clone the REMORA
and AMReX codes, and for how to build and run a REMORA example.  Mimimum requirements for system software are also given there.

Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Documentation of the REMORA theory and implementation is available `here <https://remora-ocean.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ .

In addition, there is doxygen documentation of the REMORA Code available `here <https://seahorce-scidac.github.io/docs/index.html>`_

Development model
